# Python Data Visualization Program Collection

This repository contains a collection of Python programs that help visualize various types of data using graphs and charts. Each program demonstrates a different way to represent data, making it easier to understand and analyze. Below is a list of the programs and what they do.

## Programs

### 1. Bar Plot using Matplotlib
#### Description:
This program helps you create a bar chart, which is a common way to compare different groups or categories. For example, it can help you compare sales in different months or the number of people in various age groups.

---

### 2. Histogram Plot using Matplotlib
#### Description:
A histogram helps show how data is distributed. For example, it can show how many people scored within certain ranges on a test, or the distribution of temperatures over a month.

---

### 3. Pie Chart using Matplotlib
#### Description:
A pie chart is a circular chart that shows how a whole is divided into parts. It is great for representing percentages, like showing how much each department contributes to total sales.

---

### 4. Line Plotting with Line Formatting using Matplotlib
#### Description:
A line plot is used to show trends or changes over time, like the rise and fall of temperatures each day or the performance of a company’s stock over the year.

---

### 5. Stacked Area Plot and Subplot using Matplotlib
#### Description:
This program creates an area chart, where different categories are stacked on top of each other, making it easy to see the total and individual contributions. It also shows how to organize multiple graphs in one view.

---

### 6. Customizing Seaborn Plots with Aesthetic Functions
#### Description:
This program focuses on making your charts look nicer. It helps you adjust the colors, style, and overall look of your graphs to make them more visually appealing and easier to understand.

---

### 7. Bokeh Line Graph with Annotations and Legends
#### Description:
This program helps you create line graphs with extra information, like labels or explanations added directly on the graph. It also shows how to include a legend to explain what each line represents.

---

### 8. Plotting Different Types of Plots using Bokeh
#### Description:
Bokeh is a tool that helps you create various types of charts. This program shows how to make multiple types of visualizations, such as line graphs, scatter plots, and more, all within one program.

---

### 9. 3D Plots using Plotly
#### Description:
This program helps create 3D visualizations. It’s useful for showing complex data, like the shape of a mountain or a 3D map of a city, in a way that lets you view it from different angles.

---

### 10. Time Series using Plotly
#### Description:
Time series charts are used to show how something changes over time. This program helps you create charts that track trends over days, months, or even years—like tracking sales over a year or the number of visitors to a website each month.

---

### 11. Creating Maps using Plotly
#### Description:
This program helps you create maps to represent data geographically. For example, it can show the distribution of a product across various regions or visualize weather patterns around the world.

### 12. Visualizing Immigration Data to Canada (1980–2013)
#### Description:
This program looks at immigration data to Canada over several decades and shows various ways to visualize this data, such as:
1. Showing the immigration trends from the top six countries.
2. Comparing yearly immigration numbers from a specific country.
3. Visualizing the differences in immigration from different countries using charts.
4. There is a data set file named "canadian_immigration_data.csv"

### 13. Flight Data Visualization (2019 & 2020)
#### Description:
This program looks at flight data for January 2019 and 2020. It shows how to visualize differences in the data, such as:
1. How far flights traveled in both years.
2. How many flights went to certain airports.
3. Showing the difference between the two years using a sunburst chart.

### 14. Visualizing Campus Recruitment Data
#### Description:
This program visualizes campus recruitment data and helps compare various aspects, like:
1. Showing the distribution of scores or data with histograms and bar charts.
2. Comparing different categories of recruitment data using plots like facet plots and pair plots.
3. Using area and pie charts to visualize yes/no data, such as whether or not a student got placed.
